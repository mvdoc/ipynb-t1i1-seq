This is an example jupyter notebook to show how to use a [Type-1,
Index-1 (T1I1)
sequence](https://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/public:t1i1_sequences) to
obtain ordering of the stimuli. It is based on [Geoffrey Aguirre
Lab](https://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/)'s Python code, which is
available
[here](https://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/public:web-based_sequence_evaluator)
and added to this GitHub repository. All credits for the implementation
go to  [Geoffrey Aguirre Lab](https://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/) and
Daniel M. Drucker.
